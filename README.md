# Countdown

A simple countdown page. A demo can be found here [here](https://projects.timschneider.xyz/countdown).

## Instructions

The target date can be specified at the top of the [countdown.js](https://github.com/RanzigeButter/Countdown/blob/master/src/assets/js/scripts/countdown.js) file. It is also possible to do something when the countdown has expired, which can be declared in the expired() function.
